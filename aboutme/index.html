    <h2>Douglas R. Santos</h2>
    <p>My name is Douglas. I'm from Brazil.<br>
        I always loved programming but I hadn't had the chance to do a real course about it untill now.
        I'm currently enrolled for Web and Computer Programming and my Final Goal is to have the Bachelor Degree in Software Development.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Later on, I plan to work from home and maybe for an abroad company. I think this way I will be able to dedicate myself for my family and 
        Church callings, be more flexible during my day and be more around my family. I know I need to be very organized so this life style could work, but I want to try it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As I mentioned my family, I am married and we have a little girl. My wife and I have both our degrees already. I'm a Mechanical Engineer and she is a Dentist.
        We are both members of the Church since we were bornt. Our parents joined the Church when they were teenagers and our family is very blessed for their decision and their choices.
